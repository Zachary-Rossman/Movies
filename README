# CineScout

This application utilizes the OMDb API to allow users to search for movies and series that they love.

## Description

Users are presented with a home screen where they can make a search. The user selects between **movies** or **series**, then types the name of the movie or series they would like to find.

- If the input is empty or no results are found, a **styled error message** will display.
- If results are found, the title of the movie or series is displayed along with the **year of release** and a **poster**.
- Users can navigate multiple pages of results using pagination buttons, as the OMDb API only shows **10 results per page**.
- Every new search clears previous results or errors, showing only the current search results.

### Executing program

- Open `index.html` in a browser
- Select whether you want to search for a **movie** or **series** from the dropdown menu
- Type the name of the movie or series you want to find
- Results will appear below the form as cards with title, year, and poster
- If no results are found or nothing is typed, a **styled error message** will display
- Navigate multiple pages of results using the **Previous / Next** buttons
- Repeat the process to perform a new search; previous results are cleared automatically
