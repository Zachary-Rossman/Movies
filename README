# Movie Search

This application will utilize an API to allow users to search for movies and series that they love.

## Description

Users will be prompted with a home screen that will allow them to make a search. The user will have to select between movies or series, then type in the name of the movie or series they would like to find. If there is nothing typed or if nothing is found in the API in the search results, the user will be prompted with an error message. If results are found, the title of the movie or show will be displayed along with the year of release, and a poster of the movie or series. If user would like to see multiple pages of results, the user will be able to select search result pages because the OMDB API used only shows 10 results at a time. Any time the user submits the search form again, the page will be cleared of any previous results or errors, and will only display current information to the user based on their input.

### Executing program

- Open HTML page in browser
- Select whether you would like to search for a movie or series from the dropdown menu
- Type in the name of movie or series you would like to find
- Results will show below form that was submitted
- If no results are found or there is nothing typed, an error message will display instead of results
- To search for something else, simply repeat the process and the page will clear every time a search is made
